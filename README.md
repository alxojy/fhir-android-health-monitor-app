# FIT3077 Assignment 2 & 3 Semester 1 2020

The purpose of this assignment is to create an application that assists healthcare practitioners in monitoring patients by using the FHIR server. Our group has decided to create an Android mobile application which uses the ```hapi-fhir-android``` module to support getting data from the FHIR server.
